## How can you help the Open Teach R project?

If you know a little bit of R and would like to see more people using it, then you can help! Having some experience in teaching it makes things even better, but that's not a prerequisite to join.

**Roughly speaking, we need two kinds of contributors (but you can be a mix of them):**
 - You can help building courseware if you have some experience in using or teaching R;
 - You can help testing the material as it is being built if you want to try teaching with it, even if you never done that before.

**Also, we would love to get help at leats two non R related issues:**
 - I live and work in Brazil, and I would love to get all the material translated to Portuguese;
 - It would be great for this project to have a nice looking and easy to use website, and any help with that would be really amazing.
 
You can start getting involved in the project just by saying [hi here](https://github.com/marcosvital/teach-R-project/issues/1) and talking a little bit about yourself and how you can help us. We also have a [Gitter channel here](https://gitter.im/teach-R-project/Lobby), and you can drop by to talk to us anytime.

More info might be coming soon to this file, but the project is already working, so you can (and should) contact us at anytime! ;)
