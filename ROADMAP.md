## Roadmap

This Roadmap was built as the Open Teach R Project was born during [Mozilla Open Leadership Training](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/), and helped me to share our main goals and objectives. Iâ€™m keeping it both as a kind of historical reference for the project and as a way to keep the project going with new goals.

The project initial idea can be found here at this [Open Canvas](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZDKzSF64HmPM8T45r_moJw2Rxz1T22HpjAn8SvtzW4M/edit?usp=sharing), also built during the training.
